### Yo there, welcome to dark magic üëã
While the dark arts have a bad reputation, overall, dark magic is not, by definition, "evil" magic. Indeed, dark magic can be used for good as well as evil. (see [Harry Potter - Dark Arts](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Arts#Ethical_considerations))

> ‚ÄúCuriosity is not a sin‚Ä¶. But we should exercise caution with our curiosity‚Ä¶ yes, indeed.‚Äù ‚Äî Albus Dumbledore
